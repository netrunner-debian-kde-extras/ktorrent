ktorrent (3.2~~svn839064-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream development snapshot:
    - Revision 839064 by guisson on 2008-07-29 13:51:20 +0300.
    - The latest translations as of 2008-07-29 14:29:00 +0300 are included in
      the original tarball.
    - Improvements:
      * Lower CPU usage
      * KTorrent plasmoid.
      * BitFinder and Scripting plugins.
  * Add 01_touch_proper_dnd_file.diff patch which fixes a bug causing ktorrent
    to allocate useless filled with zeros in place of first and last chunks.
    dnd files for each "Do not download" file in the multifile torrent.
    When there are many small files in the torrent, disk usage of those dnd
    files become very significant (up to 10-20% of the torrent size) and
    allocation of such a torrent is very slow due to lots of I/O during writing
    useless zeros.
  * Refresh other patches.
  * Switch packaging from CDBS to debhelper 7 (based on amarok 2 packaging).
  * Build-depend on libplasma-dev.
  * Update build-depends to at least KDE 4.1.0.
  * Update ktorrent.install file: new plugins and KTorrent plasmoid.
  * Remove Vcs fields from the debian/control until ktorrent packaging is
    moved to git.

    - The original tarball has never been released upstream. It's a snapshot
      of KDE subversion repository /trunk/extragear/network/ktorrent with DFSG
      non-free files removed.
    - The latest included svn revision is r793490 commited by guisson
      on 2008-04-04 10:45:34 +0300
    - The latest translations as of Fri, 04 Apr 2008 19:30:46 +0300 are
      included in the original tarball.
  * There are a few missing symbols in libbtcore3. Ignore this fact for now as
    there are no rdepends and it's a development snapshot anyway.
  * As always, add ktorrent-dbg to ktorrent Recommends as it's development
    snapshot.
  * Adopt debian/rules to debian/cdbs/kde.mk changes:
    - Now I need to reset DEB_DH_INSTALL_SOURCEDIR instead of
      DEB_DH_INSTALL_ARGS to get rid of --sourcedir=debian/tmp.

ktorrent (3.0.0.dfsg.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Modestas Vainius ]
  * New upstream stable release (3.0) for KDE4:
    - IPv6 support
    - SOCKSv4 and v5 support
    - The network interface to use, can now be selected
    - Alternative flat list mode to display the files of a torrent
    - Reorganization of the config dialog
    - Individual files of a torrent can now be moved
    - New queuemanager gui
  * Remove ktorrent-dbg from ktorrent Recommends. Ktorrent 3 is stable now
    (and I can confirm that from my experience).
  * Drop kdebase-runtime-data-common and kdebase-data from ktorrent
    Recommends, because actually kdebase-runtime-data-common is ktorrent
    dependency via kdebase-runtime-data. As a result, it makes no sence to
    recommend any alternatives too.
  * Remove RSS plugin from ktorrent description. It is not available in this
    release yet.
  * List more features in ktorrent description.
  * Resync patches:
    - 01_system_geoip_and_flags.diff - removed, merged upstream.
    - 02_kclosestnodessearch_cleanup.diff - removed, useless.
    - 03_trunk_pull_r769910.diff - removed, it was taken from upstream.
    - 04_pastedialog_support_remote_urls.diff - removed, merged upstream.
    - 05_infowidget_localizednumber.diff - removed, merged upstream.
  * Rename libbtcore2 to libbtcore3. Library changed soname though there was
    no real need. Anyway, I notified upstream but I'm doing the change this
    time. Modified files:
    - debian/rules, debian/control
    - debian/libbtcore2.symbols.amd64 -> debian/libbtcore3.symbols.amd64
    - debian/libbtcore2.install -> debian/libbtcore3.install
  * Internal libktcore library changed soname too. Adjust
    debian/ktorrent.install

ktorrent (3.0~rc1.dfsg.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Modestas Vainius ]
  * New upstream development release for KDE4 (3.0 rc1)
  * Major part of packaging was done from scratch in comparision with
    2.2.4.dfsg.1-1 therefore some changes might have been left undocumented
    in this changelog.
  * Remove all GeoIP stuff from ktorrent tarball including LGPL library
    source code. Debian uses libgeoip1 anyway.
  * Switching to CDBS and debhelper v6. Build-Depend on cdbs (>= 0.4.51)
    to get non-empty -dbg package with compat=6.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.7.3.0
  * Now ktorrent-dbg recommends kdelibs5-dbg due to obvious reasons. Also add
    ktorrent-dbg to ktorrent Recommends because this is upstream development
    release.
  * Drop Homepage stanza from ktorrent description, add Homepage field to
    debian/control source section instead.
  * New binary packages (libbtcore2 and libbtcore-dev) for btcore public
    library.
  * Add symbols file for libbtcore2 on amd64. Unfortunately, different
    internal type of __SIZE_TYPE__ on at least amd64 and i386 (which as a
    result affect C++ mangling of one symbol) and differing vtable offsets
    (C++ specific) prevent me from making this symbols file arch any.
  * Add kdebase-runtime-data-common as an alternative for kdebase-data in
    ktorrent Recommends. They both ship flags used by ktorrent infowidget
    plugin.
  * Remove all patches from ktorrent 2.2.x. Add new patches:
    - 01_system_geoip_and_flags.diff - add support for "system GeoIP" and
      ability to skip installation of builtin country flags to the build
      system.
    - 02_kclosestnodessearch_cleanup.dif - cleanup unused variable. Endless
      loop is fixed in 3.0rc1.
    - 03_trunk_pull_r769910.diff - pull trunk up to revision 769910. Version
      bump related changes skipped. This patch should fix socket leak which
      made ktorrent almost unusable for more than 20 minutes.
    - 04_pastedialog_support_remote_urls.diff - add back support for remote
      urls in "Paste Torrent URL" dialog. The patch fixes incorrect KUrl API
      usage.
    - 05_infowidget_localizednumber.diff - show localized number instead of
      "1e+02 %" in infowidget "Files" view "% Complete" column.
  * Add "DM-Upload-Allowed: yes" to debian/control source section.
  * Tweak overrides.lintian by adding "libktcore2 libktupnp1" to
    package-name-doesnt-match-sonames. These libraries are supposed to be used
    only by KTorrent and its utilities.
  * A few corrections to ktorrent.1 manual page, also remove ktshell.1 man
    page, because ktshell has not been ported yet.
  * Add a man page for the new 'ktupnptest' binary.
  * Bug fixes:
    - "Refuses to add downloads to existing group" - seems to work in this
      release (Closes: #460470).
    - "wrong translate" - the string in question is translated differently in
      this release. If I'm not wrong, the translation is correct
      (Closes: #459241).
    - "chunks window download speed column is misleading" - ktorrent 3.0
      groups all chunks from the same peer into single listitem for which
      only single total speed associated with that peer is shown. Therefore,
      there is no confusion anymore (Closes: #372162).
  * Update debian/copyright.

ktorrent (2.2.4.dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Modestas Vainius]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #452334):
    - Resolves frequent crashes on some systems (esp. SMP) (hence medium
      urgency).
    - "Set max upload/download rate" via tray icon menu should work correctly
      now.
    - A few additional web gui features.
  * Add a few new patches to make cleverer dpkg-shlibdeps happy (almost):
    - 05_cleanup_am_lib_qt.diff - originally a few other libraries like
      libpng12 etc. were exported in automake LIB_QT variable. Only a few (if
      any) KDE applications use them directly so linking any single binary
      against them is unnecessary. KTorrent is not an exception. This patch
      reduces LIB_QT to contain just the main Qt library. Previous version of the
      variable has been made available under the name LIB_QT_EXT. As a result of
      this patch, KTorrent depencences shrank to the bare minumum solving tons
      of dpkg-shlibdeps warnings too.
    - 06_makefile_am_fixups.diff - various fixes to Makefile.am's all around
      the source code with the intention to resolve warnings reported by
      dpkg-shlibdeps. The only type of warnings left are those regarding
      libm.so.6, which can't be fixed because they come from g++ itself.

    - MAJOR improvements in down and upload performance
    - Grouping feature to put torrents into groups
    - Improved search plugin, which now allows multiple searches
    - Allows setting priority for files in multifile torrents (Closes: #367120)
    - Download speed is shown individually for each chunk in the chunk

   - Fixed crash in parsing of DHT messages (Closes: #425043)
   - Fixed problem with files with .. in their name (Closes: #425948)
   - ScanFolder can now handle incomplete torrent files properly
  * Prune upstream tarball from non-free parts (GeoIP Country Database and
    country flag images). Patches 10 and 11 have been developed to make
    impact of this as minimal as possible on the users.
  * Remove LDFLAGS patch. It has been integrated upstream.
  * debian/rules: upstream no longer ships .desktop files in applnk.
  * Pass --enable-largefile to configure to enable large file (over 2GB)
    support on 32bit architectures. There are known problems with >4GB files
    on all architectures though (Closes: #402185).
  * Use quilt as a patch management system.
  * New patches:
    - 10_use-system-geoip.diff - adds support for the --enable-system-geoip
      configure parameter. It makes ktorrent build against system-wide GeoIP
      library (libgeoip1) and use libgeoip1 default GeoIP Country database.
    - 11_flagdb-alternative-source.diff - adds support for the
      --disable-builtin-country-flags configure parameter. It allows to skip
      installation of non-free ktorrent builtin country flags. In addition,
      the patch adds support for the "flag database" that lets ktorrent get
      country flag images from more than one filesystem source transparently.
      It also adds additional (and the only for the debian package) source -
      flag images shipped with kdebase.
    - 12_gnu_kfreebsd.diff - fix FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD. Thanks to Petr Salinger
      (Closes: #401753).
    - Usual build system patches for relibtoolization.
  * Add libgeoip-dev to Build-Depends. Build ktorrent with system GeoIP.
  * Add kdebase-data to Recommends. It is needed as a source of the country
    flag images for the Peer View. If not installed, country flags won't be
    shown.
  * Add debian/ktorrent.install. Prepare for multiple binary packages.
  * Add Ktorrent to Debian menu (Closes: #392893).
  * Now 'clean' target fully cleans the source tree after build
